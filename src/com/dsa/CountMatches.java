1688. Count of Matches in Tournament

You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.

Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.



Example 1:

Input: n = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: Details of the tournament:
        - 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
        - 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
        - 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.

Example 2:

Input: n = 14
Output: 13
Explanation: Details of the tournament:
        - 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.
        - 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
        - 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
        - 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.*/

//
//    No matter how the tournament is structured (even teams, odd teams, byes, etc.), the total number of matches is always the same:
//
//            ðŸ‘‰ n - 1 matches for n teams
//
//ðŸ”Ž Why is it always the same?
//
//    Think of it this way:
//
//    We start with n teams.
//
//    We need to find 1 winner.
//
//    That means all other n-1 teams must be eliminated.
//
//    Now, in a tournament:
//
//    Every match eliminates exactly 1 team.
//
//    So to eliminate n-1 teams, we must play exactly n-1 matches.
//            Thereâ€™s no way around it â€” you canâ€™t eliminate 2 teams in 1 match, and you canâ€™t have fewer than n-1 eliminations.
